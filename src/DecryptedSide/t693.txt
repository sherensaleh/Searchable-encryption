subject a reflection on memorial day



 
 
 we approach  another holiday weekend and far too many will  forget the reason for memorial day
a comrade from years ago now living in bangkok sends  this address really a prayer that puts the day we honor our heroes in perspective it was  delivered at the close of world war two on an island that saw some of the fiercest fighting of that terrible war the message is timeless

jeff hodge asked that i respond to your email  

ena does use the gisb contract to conduct its spot business  by spot i 
mean interruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or less 
in duration  enron also has its own form of spot agreement that we use  i 
have attached a copy of that agreement

we do try to negotiate some special provisions into each gisb  our current 
version of the special provisions is included in the gisb agreement that is 
attached  i do not know of any company that uses the gisb as is

we do not use the gisb for firm deals that are greater than one month in 
duration  for those deals we use our enfolio master firm purchase sale 
agreement that i have attached

if you need copies of actual confirmations bob bowen or ellen wallumrod 
would be able to give you examples  form confirmations are at the back of 
each of the agreements attached

if you need additional information please let me know

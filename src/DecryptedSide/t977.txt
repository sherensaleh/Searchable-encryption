subject buy resells


group quick reminder  when doing a buy resale where we are purchasing from a 
counterparty please make the buy price the price you pay the counterparty 
and the sell price the price the counterparty pays you so for  
buy resale  the legs would be a buy  and a sell at  
in scheduling you will see a positive price of negative price in 
scheduling represents  getting paid if you have questions please ask

thanks

subject partnership information to bernstein


ken
beau and i would like to share the family partnership and investment
information with bernstein to get their family wealth group up to speed  we
think they can provide a perspective on diversification and they will do it
at no cost and without an established relationship unlike most of the
investment banks  painewebber needs your permission to release the
information  would you please send rocky a letter authorizing beau or me to
release this information to third parties so we can move forward

thanks
mark

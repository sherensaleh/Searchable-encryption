rick causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called 
ibuyit one of the special ibuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices

choose budget codes from simple drop down menus

approved and view an electronic image of the actual invoice

the time you spend processing invoices for payment the ap tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use

processing functions to a third party sourcenet solutions this transition 
is expected to be completed by august

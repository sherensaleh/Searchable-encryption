subject now it is the time to cut cost


ken

iam not a smart man however i saw enron stock reached i worry one thing

under current situation it is difficult to make more money how could we boost stock price

enron hired enough people already it is the time to cut cost freeze hiring new people now

freezing hire is much more better than lay off in a near future

thanks

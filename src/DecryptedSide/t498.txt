subject sacramento bee special on electricity crisis



sac bee did a very big story recounting its version of how  electric market got upside down  cites 
enron scheduling a large block of power over a small tx line as an indicator  also cites the dinner davis 
had with generators leading up to the crisis where the paper says the generators warned him but davis took the money and did nothing

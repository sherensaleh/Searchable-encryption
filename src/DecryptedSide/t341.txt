the astros playoff tickets were much appreciated  i had a great time  even though the outcome of the two games was not as we would have liked   heather and i took her dad and josh two baseball diehards
 to one of the  games and i took some friends to the other  everyone was thrilled to be  able to go and extremely thankful for the tickets  thanks again for your  generousity and more importantly
 not objecting to me being out of the  office for a few hours to attend the game
 
love

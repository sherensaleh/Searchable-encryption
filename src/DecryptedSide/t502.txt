subject silicon valley bank


ken

i called your office today and they informed me that the best way to get
this matter to you was to send you an email  the negotiations between
silicon valley bank and evelocity have pretty much come to a decision point
at bottom silicon valley bank will agree to renew the loan for six months
in exchange for paydown and monthly interest payments for the next 
months  the evelocity folks tell me that this is slightly better from a
total cash outlay than they had proposed but it does require additional
cash upfront  in addition to the funds that you indicated that you would be
willing to provide they have secured an additional  from other
investors

the evelocity management tells me that the proposed plan gives them the
liquidity they need

i told them to proceed on that basis until i can get a response from you and
that i would recommend the banks terms to you

may  have your agreement

if you have any questions you can reach me throughout
friday  throughout the weekend

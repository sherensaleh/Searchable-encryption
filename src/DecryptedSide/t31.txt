i do remember working on an assignment agreement regarding the assignment of 
the columbia energy contracts with mscgi  to enron north america corp  i 
will need to find the document

it is my understanding that with the exception of one deal all the deals 
between ena and mscgi are firm deals of greater than one month duration  ena 
uses the gisb for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any 
length as recommended by the gas industry standards board  for firm deals 
that are longer than one month ena uses a master firm agreement if one 
exists  if there is no master firm agreement we send out our general terms 
and conditions with our confirmation  that answers your question of why 
ellen sent our gtc when there is a gisp in place

it appears to me that you and i need to work on getting a master firm 
agreement in place  please let me know your thoughts

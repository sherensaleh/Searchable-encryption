subject epe model


there have been many occasions where individuals have not saved the model at 
the end of the day this means that the last one two five hours are not 
updated  i then have to go back and enter the data off the historical 
scrapes as well as the actual econ deals themselves  you can imagine how 
frustrating this is for me it is very easy to save the model and time 
consuming to update it all after the fact  besides annoying me it also 
looks bad to epe when they get a model that is wrong do not forget to 
save it is completely sloppy and totally unacceptable  save and save 
often

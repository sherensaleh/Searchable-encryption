russell  

we are trying to get five month sale in place with wepco  and stacy dickson 
said it would be possible to do the sale under a gisb if credit provisions 
were attached under the special provision section  

the deal we are interested in is a day sale at alliance with a 
price of nymex   they would like the right to fix nymex at any 
time what credit terms would you require material adverse change letter 
of credit would you guys need

thanks

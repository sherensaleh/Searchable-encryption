group

this morning we had a meeting with  regarding grays harbor paper in an 
attempt to clarify exactly what we need to do in order to make the deal run 
smoothly informed us that a phone call is the end of each 
hour to inform their numbers desk  and reference account of the actual generation output of the unit has the expected 
output in their system based on preschedules or  sales and then enters the 
actual output in order to determine if  has met their reserve requirements 
by comparing the two for the entire control area if we do not call the 
actuals in they assume that the units output is zero and we get billed for 
being short those

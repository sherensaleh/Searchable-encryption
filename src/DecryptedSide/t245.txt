from geir solberg
to portland shift
subject ncpa br is back


hey guys 

i had a long talk with  today and set up so that we again can do the  buy resale on a realtime basis we are not doing a profit split 
this time we are paying them  instead this basically enables us to 
shift  across and not be subject to congestion as has 
grandfather rights across the path this is a sweet strategy when the 
 spread is there and  is congested capacity is 
but i would not recommend doing more than there are others who know 
about this opportunity but are not currently using it  so 
by doing only  we do not remind them 

the way this works is that we call  and ask their capacity across  
and tell them you want to schedule the  through whatever hour



we can buy  to fill our  sale we just shift the load from  to  so enter  so if you are not passing phase two give them a call

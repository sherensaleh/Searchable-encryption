subject diversity points presentation

i think this looks good  there is one other area that you may want to include  develop relationships with governmental agencies that enforce discrimination affirmative action laws regulations and executive orders  
 
i have been taking the lead on this with support from steve kean and cindy but we are just starting the effort this month  steve and i will meet with the office of federal contract compliance programs this week and iam hoping to meet with the head  and perhaps folks  in washington later in the month  i believe that cordial cooperative relationships with these agencies can be invaluable in our diversity efforts
 
if you choose to include this activity it probably would belong in the communication or resources sections it could be included in the section on creation of external relationships
 
let me know if you have any questions

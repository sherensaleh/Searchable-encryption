subject are you receiving anything


dear ken 
ihave sent you two emails and a package last week  
i have not heard from you via email so am wondering if you have received anything
  i hope so  i will make a copy of the past emails and send them to you by mail if you would prefer
  i can also put together a whole proposal if you need me too  
just let me know via email if you can  
i understand that you must get hundreds of emails a day  
i hope this does not burden you in the least  i remain hopeful that laura will grace us in april  
thanks again 
serving him

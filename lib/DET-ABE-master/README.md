# DET-ABE-API

 This software is part of the --DET-ABE API--, a Java library developed as part of the SCABE project (Secure Storage and Sharing 
 of data in the Cloud by using  Attribute based encryption).
 The DET-ABE library is free software. This library is distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either expressed or implied.

Before using this software:

1. You must have installed jPBC: http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/#.Ved6Qfl_NBc.
There is an inconsistency when creating the pairing using curve parameters stored in a file. The current version of jPBC produces this error so you can use the previous version of the jPBC .jar files.  You can find these files in this repository.
2. You must update your Java distribution with the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html. This is in order to use encryption security levels of 128, 192, and 256 bits. 
3. This is a standalone implementation of DET-ABE, all code run on the same machine
4. Elliptic Curve parameter and keys (PK and MK for different security levels) are available for use in the "params" and "bsw" folders. When you run DET-ABE or CP-ABE, the pairing is constructed from the parameters already stored in the "params" folder, and the PK and MK keys are re-constructed from the data stored in "bsw/keys"
5. In this vesion, attributes are any text-string (not duplicated by the moment)
6. Source code for testing AES, CP-ABE, and DET-ABE are available in the folder "test/bswabe/".
7. Please note that DET-ABE uses CP-ABE and AES to implement the digital envelope concept, where a large amount of data is encrypted with AES and the AES-key is encrypted with CP-ABE. At this moment, the CP-ABE implementation provided here supports the three AES security levels: 128, 192, and 256.
8. As a guide, the output of the test program for DET-ABE in the file /test/bswabe/testDETABE.java is shown in the .txt file "output DET-ABE.txt". The corresponding output of the test program for CP-ABE in the file /test/bswabe/testCPABE.java is shown in the .txt file "output CP-ABE.txt".

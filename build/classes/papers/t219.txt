this morning we had a meeting with  regarding grays harbor paper in an 
attempt to clarify exactly what we need to do in order to make the deal run 
smoothly informed us that a phone call is the end of each 
hour to inform their numbers desk  and reference account of the actual generation output of the unit has the expected 
output in their system based on preschedules or  sales and then enters the 
actual output in order to determine if  has met their reserve requirements 
by comparing the two for the entire control area if we do not call the 
actuals in they assume that the units output is zero and we get billed for 
being short those  

when you call the  numbers desk you need to give them the total output 
of the plant they are required to give the first  to load and the next 
four to us for marketing however wants to know  of the 
unit which would be   they would like the numbers within the first  
 minutes of every hour

this is very important and cannot be overlooked let me know if you have any 
ideas about how to remind everyone to make the call do we need an alarm at 
 minutes after every hour

we also discussed procedure when the unit trips we have to call the  
generation desk within  minutes of the unit tripping  we are going to 
emphasise the importance of grays harbor calling us immediately so that we 
may notify  within the required  minutes  once again if we fail to do 
this we will be fined according to their tariff

if you have any questions donot hesitate to ask les can also be a helpful 
resource on this

cheers

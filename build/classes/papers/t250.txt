virginia is exactly correct on this point the majority of 
inadvertancy that we have contributed to and there hasnot been that much 
has been a result of confusion on times and duration of trades  
thanks

dear real timers

as i have been having to pull tapes lately i cannot stress enough the 
importance of stating the hour for which you are trading when you make 
deals it is imperative that you state as often as possible the hours that 
you are trading for and it is extremely helpful when you recap the sale at 
the end of your trade please

there may be deals that we are going to loose the dispute for because neither 
trader on either side stated clearly what hour we were trading for iam 
relying on you guys to help me collect  on all our trades

please see or email me with any questions

thanks

virginia

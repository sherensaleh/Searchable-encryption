when doing an import or an export from california there are a few important 
guidelines to remember

this must be firm firm import is required so that we provide the 
spinning reserves to california we do this by buying firm energy for the 
import if the import is non firm california will charge us their price 
for spinning reserve margins this could easily be  per come this 
summer


this must be  non firm export allows us to provide 
spinning reserves to our bilat trading partners or to simply sell the energy 
without spinning reserves as non firm and not have to pay the california 
price for spinning reserve margins conversely if we do a firm export we 
would have to pay for california to supply spinning reserves and because 
california will sometime use actual purchased energy for spinning reserves
this could easily be  per  this summer
california has also proposed cutting firm exports this summer so  firm 
export does not imply that the energy would actually be exported anymore than 
nonfirm

if you have other questions please let me know

thanks

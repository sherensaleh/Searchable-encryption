subject power world drawing and contingency files


sevil 

i have attached a detailed map of the ercot system and line 
and buses  the map is based on the  summer peak load flow case 
enron paid about  for this map so we do not need to disclose it to 
outside personnel

i also have a detailed map of the eastern interconnect i believe it is down 
to the level

i have also attached contingency file  for ease of importing a 
standard list of line contingencies that i obtained from the iso

i have also attached an ercot injection group  which is valuable for 
the years after  because of one constrol group

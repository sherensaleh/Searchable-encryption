subject calif energy future


dear ken

i hope you visit with the governor was as fruitful as mine  we are
very favorably supported in our development of a regional energy
efficiency initiative  an approach to defining and delivering
sustainable energy efficiency not conservation

there is an opportunity to discuss a way in which enron could perhaps
become involved in a very significant set of new developments within the
sphere of influence in which i operate  if you wish to look into this
 let me know  ibelieve such an endeavor during this difficult time
might well stand you in good stead  and its a way to enter the end use
services business

i look forward to getting to aspen  for the ai conference

john

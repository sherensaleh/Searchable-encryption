subject thank you


mr lay 

for the past five days i have been on a medical mission trip to honduras five of which werenot
scheduled but were necessary because continental canceled flights in light of our nation
tragedy

although honduras is a third world country and very little american news makes it there i was
told that enron had donated one million dollars to the red cross and was matching employee donations 
 in response to the terrorist attacks on our ountry it made me even more proud 
to work for this company and to work for you

 canot tell you what an honor it is to work for this company and for you you hear countless stories
of what you and enron have done for our community

sincerely

josh duncan

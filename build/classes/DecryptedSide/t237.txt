subject iso hour ahead schedule adjustments

bill

can you make an effort to tell everyone in real time to try to remember to 
contact the services customers when a schedule adjustment that incs of decs 
their generation comes from the iso if we tell them what their final 
schedule is they canot argue that it was our fault even if we do not 
notify them it is currently our position that it is not our fault but at a 
minimum for customer service we should try to notify them

thanks

chris

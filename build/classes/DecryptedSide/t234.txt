subject scheduling wheels


just a reminder that when entering a wheel the interchange id must be the 
same for the import and export when the import is labeled as  
and the export as  the iso views these as unique imports and 
exports they will not be linked together for a wheel thus causing 
ancillary services charges to occur

thank you

subject conversion rate


dear ceo kenneth lay

the conversion rate  is not acceptable to shareholders it should be
at least  or above we need to get bidders and more banks to back up enron
while talking to dynergy ratio was proposed by some analysts who short
the ene stocks when the price was at above  the number  was published
in media again last week or so ene should not take this outrage number
these hedge fund and short sellers will be happy if the ratio is  i
think  ratio is our bottom line

may god gives you wisdom

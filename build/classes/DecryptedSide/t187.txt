ken

thank you for speaking with tillman  as requested i spoke with him yesterday along with his cfo  there was confusion on their part 
as to what enron offer is related to a meeting some months back by our former bundled group
  i updated them as to our current offering and they expressed interest in receiving some pricing
  the ball is in their court to provide me some information to price their stores but i hope to receive something from them soon

i will let you know where we wind up

thanks again

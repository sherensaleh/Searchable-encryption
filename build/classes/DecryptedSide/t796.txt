ken

i donot know if you are the right person for this  
but i thought that someone should register enron in the new domain asap before we lose them

although iam in it  iam not really in the right area and neither is my direct chain of command although i think they are just great to work for


sorry to have troubled you but  i know that if i mention it then you will get it to the right person for consideration

many thanks

andrew henderson

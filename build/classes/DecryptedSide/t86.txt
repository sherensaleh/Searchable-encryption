hi stacy

bridgette anderson is currently briefing a new enfolio master purchase sale 
firm with cargill but it is not an enfolio it has provisions for 
collateral and includes an enron guaranty and limited power of attorney

i know if it said enfolio  it would be okay to use it in eol and i 
believe it is good  but i want to confirm that with you  also 
what is the difference between the two contracts  is it just the collateral 
provisions and guaranty that make it different  i would attach a copy but it 
has not been scanned yet

thanks

susan
